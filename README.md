Tikli
=====

Tikli is a simple to use microblogging Web application coded in Ruby and
powered by Sinatra, Slim, Sass (SCSS) and Coffee-Script.

Rationale
---------

This was inspired by a project I __had to__ make in PHP (using CodeIgniter).
At the time I was studying Ruby, and I thought that it wouldn't be a bad idea
to make the same application on different frameworks: Sinatra, CodeIgniter
and Rails.

Not only would my language coding experience grow, I would also get important
knowledge about the different frameworks' working internals.

Specification
-------------

It's been coded entirely in Ruby, and it's powered by Sinatra, a great little
<acronym title="Domain Specific Language">DSL</acronym> that makes rapid
prototyping a breeze.

Since it's a Web application, _somehow_ it also uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript,
through Slim, Sass (SCSS) and Coffee-Script respectively.

From these, I would say that Slim and Coffee-Script really stand out. How
they manage to really simplify the flow, the developing process, is absolutely
out of this world. Their syntax makes me feel at home.

So?
---

I can only wish you luck, since Tikli in all of its iterations is mostly
a proof-of-concept, aimed at showing capabilities of different tools and
methodologies. I would dare saying it could be used as a learning tool!

In any case, have __fun__: _I know I did!_
