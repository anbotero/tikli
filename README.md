Tikli
=====

Tikli is a simple to use microblogging Web application made with
Sinatra, Slim, Sass (SCSS) and Coffee-Script.

Rationale
---------

This was inspired by a project I had to make in PHP (using CodeIgniter).
At the time I was studying Ruby, and I thought that it wouldn't be a bad
idea to make the same application on different frameworks: CodeIgniter,
Rails and of course Sinatra.

Specification
-------------

It's been coded entirely in Ruby. Since it's a Web application, somehow
it also uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript, through Slim, Sass (SCSS) and
Coffee-Script respectively.

So?
---

I can only wish you luck, since Tikli in all of its iterations is mostly
a proof-of-concept, aimed at showing capabilities of different tools and
methodologies. I would dare saying it could be used as a learning tool!

In any case, _have fun_: __I know I did!__
